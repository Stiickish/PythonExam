# PythonExam

A. We want to make a music recommendation app that will use machine learning algorithms to recommend different bands/albums/genres etc.
   based on the users listening preferences. 

B. We will use either the Spotify web API or Shazam API, which are free to use. 

C. Collect data from music databases. We will try to use the Panda and Mumpy libraries for the cleaning of our data, like removing duplicates, removing errors and missing items. 

D. We will visualize the data to see which genres are most popular among different user groups. (Maybe using Streamlit for frontend).
   We want to give the user access to some statistics and information about the different music they are recommended -ish.
   We will use matplotlib for the visualization of our data and statistics. 

E. We will use collaborative filtering algorithms to recommend music to users based on the bands/genres/artist/albums/tracks the user chooses as their favorite.
